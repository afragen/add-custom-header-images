Remove default header images and load custom header images from **The Headers** page.

== Description ==

A plugin that should be able to remove default headers for a theme and add custom headers based upon the article written by <a href="http://juliobiason.net/2011/10/25/twentyeleven-with-easy-rotating-header-images/">Julio Biason</a> who was inspired by <a href="http://wpti.ps/?p=107">wpti.ps</a>.

Once the custom header images are loaded, just go to `Appearance > Header` and select `Random` from the Default Images section.

== Installation ==
